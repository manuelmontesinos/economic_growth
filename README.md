# Economic Growth
The files collected in this repository reproduce the numerical solutions to dynamic stochastic economic growth models in Fortran 90. Files included:
- Numerical solution for a stochastic, discrete time version of the Solow-Swan model: [solow_stochastic.f90](https://github.com/montesinosmv/economic_growth/blob/master/solow_stochastic.f90)
- Plots of the solution to the Solow-Swan model: [solow_stochastic_output.plt](https://github.com/montesinosmv/economic_growth/blob/master/solow_stochastic_output.plt)

The previous files are accompanied by a collection of routines that are commonly used for computational economics: [routines_econ.f90.](https://github.com/montesinosmv/economic_growth/blob/master/routines_econ.f90)
